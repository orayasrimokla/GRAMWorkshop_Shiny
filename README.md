# GRAM Workshop Shiny App for Example Intervention

This application was developed based on the model found here https://github.com/Cherrylim128/economic_evaluation_tutorial and from paper "Is an active hospital microbiology laboratory cost-effective in a resource-limited setting? - a case study from Timor-Leste" by Lim et al. (https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.05.14.24307355v1)

This app evaluates the cost-effectiveness of implementing an intervention (example with maintaining an active microbiology laboratory for blood culture testing in healthcare settings). The model uses a decision tree approach to compare strategies with and without active microbiology services.

### App files are found in in the CostEffectivenessAnalysis_Shiny folder.
In this folder, run the app.R file to launch the app created for the practical_cea_decisiontree.R file

The app is also hosted online and can be found here: https://dashapps.shinyapps.io/C-E_Analysis/
