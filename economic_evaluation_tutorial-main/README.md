# A tutorial on economic evaluation using decision tree model

This repository contains the tutorial notes for the practical session developed by Cherry Lim and Ben S Cooper.

This tutorial is designed to provide an overview to economic evaluation using a decision tree model. The tutorial describes the basic concepts of decision tree model with an example on evaluation of the cost-effectiveness of active microbiology laboratory services compared against no active microbiology laboratory in a hospital in a LMIC. 

The session is organised around three simple exercises plus one optional & more challenging exercise. The exercises require participants to read, understand & edit R code, and interpret outputs. The exercises are organised as below:
- Structure of a decision tree model and how to populate the parameter values
- Estimating and interpreting ICER in R
- Deterministic sensitivity analysis
- Probabilistic sensitivity analysis (optional)

A pre-print of a paper making use of an expanded version of the model used in this tutorial can be found at https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.05.14.24307355v1.
